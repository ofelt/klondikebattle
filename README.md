# TODO  
* Keep the current heuristic IA for easy mode, implement a MonteCarlo algorithm for medium and hard  
* Implement Floyd detection cycle algorithm to prevent IA to enter in a loop with card moves  
* Show players total cards and who's turn is it in the status bar  
* Use KgDifficulty  
* Improve undo redo (undo moves of opponent until it's our turn)  
* Improve when the player has lost (show message like won())  
* Fix preview  
* The need of a special theme (!= oxygen air) so we can see cards growing/spreading on the right  
* Increment version  
* Write docbook
* Keep uptodate with Kpat
